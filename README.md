# Straw - A WIP Client-Side Programming Language

> There's nobody who doesn't know about HTML. The 'must have' client-side programming language for every website. You literally have to build your website template via HTML tags, because it's the only language browser support.
> 
> I say, no more! We have to walk into the future. We have to develop new features, new languages and new frameworks which is coming to replace the HTML language.

Straw is a new programming language and it lets you create easily web files. So why using Straw instead of HTML?

 1. First of all, the code of straw is a lot more elegant than HTML code. And the more **beautiful** the code is, the **easier** to work about the website.
 2. Straw contains a lot of features which **doesn't exist** in pure HTML. those features let you dynamically generate new web files. For example, you can write new functions and import files of **another programming languages** into your Straw code!
 3. For the general purpose, Straw may be **easier**, and the code may be **shorter**. You don't have to close tags and you can see which tag is found inside another.
 
## Requirements
 - Python 3.x

## Installation and Compiling
We don't have any official installation right now. That's a feature which will be added in the near future. Right now, you can follow the next steps to clone the project and use the compiler.

For installation, clone Straw:

    git clone https://github.com/DrBenana/Straw.git
Next, if you want to compile some file/s, just run this code:

    python [Clone Directory]/Straw/straw.py [File], [File2]...
